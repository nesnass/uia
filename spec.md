# Curate App

Web application

## Spec

1. Select image + textual content (title), allow addition of 'metadata' - colour, pattern etc - send it for analysis
2. Response is a 'matching' image(s). Allow this to be re-done with the same user image, or a different image chosen instead.
3. When response is available - make a comparison: curate the uploaded image by associating it with one or more works from a real art collection

	* For now, provide a set of images based on random selection
	* This will be improved to use AI/ML to form a response

3. Present a page that displays both images for comparison (Send URL back to user that links them to this)


Hosting options?
 	Heroku? Firebase?
Database?
Distribution?
	App or web app?

* Can images / museum image collection be accessed already at a URL? (rather than require cloud storage)
* Does the user's image need to be kept? (rather than require cloud storage)

- Three stages / screens
- No need to retain user, but possibly set a cookie would be useful to allow returning to selections
- ability to generate PDF for each matching, and download it. Use a separate URL for this?
